# GoTooFar 
Write an application named GoTooFar in which you declare an
array of five integers and store five values in the array. Write a try
block in which you loop to display each successive element of the
array, increasing a subscript by 1 on each pass through the loop.
Create a catch block that catches the eventual
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and displays the message,
“Now you’ve gone too far.”
